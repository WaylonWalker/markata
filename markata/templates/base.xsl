# Pretty Feed

Styles an RSS/Atom feed, making it friendly for humans viewers, and adds a link
to aboutfeeds.com for new user onboarding. See it in action:

   https://interconnected.org/home/feed


## How to use

1. Download this XML stylesheet from the following URL and host it on your own
   domain (this is a limitation of XSL in browsers):

   https://github.com/genmon/aboutfeeds/blob/main/tools/pretty-feed-v3.xsl

2. Include the XSL at the top of the RSS/Atom feed, like:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<?xml-stylesheet href="/PATH-TO-YOUR-STYLES/pretty-feed-v3.xsl" type="text/xsl"?>
```

3. Serve the feed with the following HTTP headers:

```
Content-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8  # not application/rss+xml
x-content-type-options: nosniff
```

(These headers are required to style feeds for users with Safari on iOS/Mac.)



## Limitations

- Styling the feed *prevents* the browser from automatically opening a
  newsreader application. This is a trade off, but it's a benefit to new users
  who won't have a newsreader installed, and they are saved from seeing or
  downloaded obscure XML content. For existing newsreader users, they will know
  to copy-and-paste the feed URL, and they get the benefit of an in-browser feed
  preview.
- Feed styling, for all browsers, is only available to site owners who control
  their own platform. The need to add both XML and HTTP headers makes this a
  limited solution.

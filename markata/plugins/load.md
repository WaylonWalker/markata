The `markata.plugins.load` plugin is responsible for loading and parsing markdown files
with frontmatter into Post objects. It provides parallel loading capabilities and
handles both modern Pydantic-based and legacy frontmatter validation.

## Installation

This plugin is built-in and enabled by default through the 'default' plugin.
If you want to be explicit, you can add it to your list of plugins:

```toml
hooks = [
    "markata.plugins.load",
]
```

## Uninstallation

Since this plugin is included in the default plugin set, to disable it you must explicitly
add it to the disabled_hooks list if you are using the 'default' plugin:

```toml
disabled_hooks = [
    "markata.plugins.load",
]
```

Note: Disabling this plugin will prevent Markata from loading any markdown files.
This will effectively disable most of Markata's functionality.

## Configuration

Configure loading behavior in your `markata.toml`:

```toml
[markata]
# Directories containing markdown content
content_directories = [
    "content",
    "posts"
]

# Optional: Set to true to use legacy frontmatter validation
legacy_frontmatter = false

# Optional: Number of worker processes for parallel loading
load_workers = 4
```

## Functionality

## File Loading

The plugin:
1. Discovers markdown files in content directories
2. Loads file content and frontmatter
3. Validates frontmatter against Post model
4. Creates Post objects for further processing

## Parallel Processing

Loading is parallelized using:
- Process pool for file reading
- Configurable number of workers
- Chunked file processing

## Validation Modes

Supports two validation approaches:
1. Modern Pydantic-based validation (default)
   - Strict type checking
   - Automatic type coercion
   - Detailed validation errors

2. Legacy frontmatter validation
   - Looser type checking
   - Compatible with older content
   - Less strict validation

## Error Handling

The plugin provides:
- Detailed validation error messages
- Per-file error reporting
- Graceful fallback to legacy mode
- Optional strict validation

## Registered Attributes

The plugin adds:
- `articles`: List of loaded Post objects
- `content_directories`: List of content source directories

## Dependencies

This plugin depends on:
- python-frontmatter for YAML parsing
- pydantic for validation
- multiprocessing for parallel loading

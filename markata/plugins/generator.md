The `markata.plugins.generator` plugin adds a meta generator tag to each generated HTML page,
indicating that the page was generated by Markata and including the version number.

## Installation

This plugin is built-in and enabled by default through the 'default' plugin.
If you want to be explicit, you can add it to your list of plugins:

```toml
hooks = [
    "markata.plugins.generator",
]
```

## Uninstallation

Since this plugin is included in the default plugin set, to disable it you must explicitly
add it to the disabled_hooks list if you are using the 'default' plugin:

```toml
disabled_hooks = [
    "markata.plugins.generator",
]
```

## Configuration

The plugin uses the global `prettify_html` configuration:

```toml
[markata]
prettify_html = true  # Set to false to disable HTML prettification
```

## Functionality

## Meta Tag Generation

The plugin adds a meta tag to the head of each HTML document:
```html
<meta name="generator" content="markata X.Y.Z">
```
where X.Y.Z is the current Markata version.

## Dependencies

This plugin depends on:
- The `render_markdown` plugin to provide HTML content

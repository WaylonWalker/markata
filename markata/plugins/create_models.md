The `markata.plugins.create_models` plugin dynamically creates Markata's core Pydantic
models by combining model fragments from various plugins. This enables extensible and
type-safe data models.

## Installation

This plugin is built-in and enabled by default through the 'default' plugin.
If you want to be explicit, you can add it to your list of plugins:

```toml
hooks = [
    "markata.plugins.create_models",
]
```

## Uninstallation

Since this plugin is included in the default plugin set, to disable it you must explicitly
add it to the disabled_hooks list if you are using the 'default' plugin:

```toml
disabled_hooks = [
    "markata.plugins.create_models",
]
```

Note: Disabling this plugin will break most of Markata's functionality as it's
responsible for creating core models.

## Configuration

No explicit configuration is required. The plugin automatically creates models from
registered model fragments.

## Functionality

## Model Creation

The plugin:
1. Collects model fragments from plugins
2. Deduplicates model definitions
3. Creates composite models
4. Registers models with Markata

## Core Models

Creates these models:
- `Post`: Individual post data
- `Posts`: Collection of posts
- `Config`: Global configuration

## Model Configuration

Applies settings:
- Environment variable prefix
- Extra field handling
- Type validation
- Copy behavior
- Base classes

## Performance

Optimizations:
- Unique model deduplication
- Lazy model creation
- Minimal validation
- Efficient inheritance

## Dependencies

This plugin depends on:
- pydantic for model creation
- more-itertools for deduplication

The `markata.plugins.datetime` plugin handles date and time parsing for posts. It ensures
consistent datetime handling by converting various date formats to timezone-aware datetime
objects.

## Installation

This plugin is built-in and enabled by default through the 'default' plugin.
If you want to be explicit, you can add it to your list of plugins:

```toml
hooks = [
    "markata.plugins.datetime",
]
```

## Uninstallation

Since this plugin is included in the default plugin set, to disable it you must explicitly
add it to the disabled_hooks list if you are using the 'default' plugin:

```toml
disabled_hooks = [
    "markata.plugins.datetime",
]
```

Note: Disabling this plugin will prevent proper date handling and sorting in other plugins.

## Configuration

This plugin requires no explicit configuration. It processes dates from post frontmatter.

## Frontmatter Usage

Specify dates in your post frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: My Post
date: 2024-01-28  # Date only
---
```

```markdown
---
title: My Post
date: 2024-01-28T12:00:00Z  # Date and time with timezone
---
```

## Functionality

## Date Parsing

The plugin supports:
- ISO format dates (2024-01-28)
- ISO format datetimes (2024-01-28T12:00:00Z)
- Natural language dates ("January 28, 2024")
- Date objects from Python
- Datetime objects with or without timezone

## Date Normalization

All dates are normalized to:
- Timezone-aware datetime objects
- UTC timezone if none specified
- Start of day (00:00:00) for date-only values

## Registered Attributes

- `date`: Converted to timezone-aware datetime object

## Dependencies

This plugin depends on:
- python-dateutil for flexible date parsing
- pytz for timezone handling

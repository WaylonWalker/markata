# Markata Changelog

## 0.2.0

* feat: auto_description plugin is all new
* deprecated: long_description has been deprecated by auto_description
* fix covers plugin which would previously skip every time.
* feat: `markata clean` cleans up your cache and output from the command line

### All New auto_description plugin

* Cache is busted on plugin change 
* plugin is configurable
* plugin now has docs

## Configuration

Open up your `markata.toml` file and add new entries for your
auto_descriptions.  You can have multiple desriptions, each one will be named
after the key you give it in your config.

``` toml
[markata]
hooks=[
   "markata.plugins.auto_description",
   ]

[markata.auto_description.description]
len=160
[markata.auto_description.long_description]
len=250
[markata.auto_description.super_description]
len=500
```

In the above we will end up with three different descritpions, 
(`description`, `long_description`, and `super_description`) each will be the
first number of characters from the document as specified in the config.

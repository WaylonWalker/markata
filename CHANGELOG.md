### breaking change to feeds config

If you are using the 0.1.0 version of feeds, and have configured custom
templates in `markata.feeds.template` and `markata.feeds.card_template` they
will need to be moved to `markata.feeds_config`.

Here is what you need to do to update your feeds_config.

``` diff
+ [markata.feeds_config]
+ template="pages/templates/archive_template.html"
+ card_template="plugins/feed_card_template.html"
- [markata.feeds]
- template="pages/templates/archive_template.html"
- card_template="plugins/feed_card_template.html"
```

`markata.feeds` will only be used to configure feeds pages.


### map entire posts

`post` is now exposed to the `markata.map` object, allowing you to return a
list of posts.

``` python
m = Markata()
# 'post' will return the entire post
m.map('post', filter='"git" in tags')
```

### Customizable colors

``` toml 
[markata]
# default dark theme
color_bg = '#1f2022'
color_bg_code = '#1f2022'
color_text = '#eefbfe'
color_link = '#47cbff' 
color_accent = '#e1bd00c9'
overlay_brightness = '.85'

# pink and purple
color_bg = 'deeppink'
color_bg_code = 'rebeccapurple'
color_text = 'white'
color_link = 'aqua' 
color_accent = 'peachpuff'
overlay_brightness = '1.2'

# default light theme
color_bg_light = '#eefbfe'
color_bg_code_light = '#eefbfe'
color_text_light = '#1f2022'
color_link_light = '#47cbff' 
color_accent_light = '#ffeb00'
overlay_brightness_light = '.95'
```

### All New auto_description plugin

* Cache is busted on plugin change 
* plugin is configurable
* plugin now has docs

### auto_description Configuration

Open up your `markata.toml` file and add new entries for your
auto_descriptions.  You can have multiple desriptions, each one will be named
after the key you give it in your config.

``` toml
[markata]
hooks=[
   "markata.plugins.auto_description",
   ]

[markata.auto_description.description]
len=160
[markata.auto_description.long_description]
len=250
[markata.auto_description.super_description]
len=500
```

In the above we will end up with three different descritpions, 
(`description`, `long_description`, and `super_description`) each will be the
first number of characters from the document as specified in the config.

### auto_descriptions are no longer duplicated

### New Heading Link Plugin

The new heading link plugin makes it easier to share the exact part of an article you want with someone, by giving clickable links to the id of the heading it's next to.
